# Archived Roadmap: MLX Model Manager v1.1

**Archived:** 2026-01-26
**Version:** 1.1.0
**Status:** SHIPPED

## Overview

Polish the UX for models and server panels, add user authentication, enhance chat with multimodal and tool-use support, and fix accumulated technical debt. Six phases moving from user-facing improvements to infrastructure hardening.

## Milestone Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases | 6 |
| Plans Executed | 37 |
| Requirements Satisfied | 29/29 |
| Duration | 2026-01-17 to 2026-01-26 |
| Release | v1.1.0 |

## Phases Summary

### Phase 1: Models Panel UX
**Goal**: Clean up models panel layout so search stays visible and downloads are consolidated
**Completed**: 2026-01-17
**Plans**: 1

Key accomplishments:
- Search/filter bar anchored to top of panel with scrollable model list below
- When download starts, original model tile is hidden and download tile appears at top
- Normal model tiles do not show progress bars (progress only on download tiles)

### Phase 2: Server Panel Redesign
**Goal**: Replace profile list with searchable dropdown and show running servers as rich metric tiles
**Completed**: 2026-01-19
**Plans**: 5

Key accomplishments:
- Profile selection via searchable dropdown with Start button
- Running servers display as rich tiles with real-time metrics (memory, CPU, uptime)
- Scroll position preserved across 5-second polling updates
- Backend metrics API using psutil for memory/CPU monitoring
- Restart tile disappearing fix (gap closure)

### Phase 3: User-Based Authentication
**Goal**: User registration/login with email+password, JWT sessions, admin approval flow
**Completed**: 2026-01-20
**Plans**: 5

Key accomplishments:
- First user to register becomes admin automatically
- Subsequent users request accounts, admin must approve before active
- JWT-based authentication with 7-day session duration
- Unauthenticated requests redirect to /login page
- Admin user management page (approve, delete, reset passwords)
- Pending approval badge count in nav (admin only)

### Phase 4: Model Discovery & Badges
**Goal**: Detect model characteristics and display visual badges for capabilities
**Completed**: 2026-01-20
**Plans**: 3

Key accomplishments:
- Model config.json parsed to extract architecture, context window, multimodal support, KV cache
- Visual badges displayed on model tiles (text-only vs multimodal, architecture type)
- Technical specs shown: context window, parameters, quantization level
- Filter/search by model characteristics works

### Phase 5: Chat Multimodal & Enhancements
**Goal**: Support image/video attachments, thinking models, and streaming chat with error handling
**Completed**: 2026-01-23
**Plans**: 5

Key accomplishments:
- Image attachments via button and drag-drop with thumbnails
- Video attachments supported (send directly to model, 2-min limit)
- Thinking models show collapsible thinking panel with "Thought for Xs"
- SSE streaming with proper error handling
- Text file attachments with universal attachment button

### Phase 6: Bug Fixes & Stability
**Goal**: Clean up technical debt: logging, cleanup, validation, polling, and fix runtime bugs
**Completed**: 2026-01-25
**Plans**: 18

Key accomplishments:
- Silent exceptions logged (no more `except: pass`)
- Server log files cleaned up on crash/exit
- API validation uses HTTPException (no assertions)
- Server status polling optimized (no excessive re-renders)
- No console.log debug statements in production
- MCP mock integration (weather/calculator) for tool-use testing
- Tool-use capability detected from model tags and shown as badge
- Profile model description uses textarea; system prompt field added
- Memory displays in appropriate units (GB when >= 1024 MB)
- Chat input wraps text and grows vertically
- Text file attachments sent as text content (not base64)
- Tool calls displayed in collapsible panel with wrench icon
- Extensionless text files (README, Makefile, Dockerfile) accepted
- Backend-mediated health polling (eliminates console errors)

## Quality Metrics at Ship

### Backend
- Tests: 550 passing
- Coverage: 97%
- Linting: ruff clean
- Type checking: mypy clean

### Frontend
- Tests: 544 passing
- Linting: eslint clean
- Type checking: svelte-check clean

### Code Quality
- Zero silent exception handlers remaining
- Zero assertions in API routes
- Zero console.log statements in production
- Zero TODO/FIXME placeholders in shipped code

## Tech Debt Carried Forward

| Item | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Throughput metrics unavailable | Info | Upstream mlx-openai-server doesn't expose tokens/s |
| GPU metrics unavailable via psutil | Info | macOS limitation |
| mlx-openai-server v1.5.0 VLM regression | Info | Upstream issue |
| GLM-4 thinking without template | Info | Acceptable fallback |
| Download completion UX gap | Warning | Doesn't auto-refresh local models list |

## Cross-Phase Integration Points

| From | To | Via |
|------|----|-----|
| Phase 3 (Auth) | All Protected Routes | JWT + route guards |
| Phase 4 (Model Config) | Phase 5 (Chat) | is_multimodal flag |
| Phase 2 (Servers) | Phase 5 (Chat) | Server health → profile selection |
| Phase 6 (System Prompt) | Phase 5 (Chat) | Profile field → initial context |
| Phase 6 (MCP Tools) | Phase 5 (Chat) | Tool toggle → forwarding → execution |
| Phase 6 (Tool-Use Badge) | Phase 4 (Badges) | Detection → characteristics → display |
| Phase 1 (Downloads) | Phase 2 (Profiles) | Download → create profile with model |

## E2E User Flows Verified

1. Model Discovery → Download → Profile → Server → Chat
2. First User Registration → Admin Setup
3. Model Characteristics → Filter → Select → Chat
4. Tool-Use Model → Badge → Chat Tools
