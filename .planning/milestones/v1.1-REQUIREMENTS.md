# Archived Requirements: MLX Model Manager v1.1

**Archived:** 2026-01-26
**Version:** 1.1.0
**Status:** SHIPPED

**Core Value:** Enable developers to easily discover, download, configure, and run MLX models locally without command-line complexity — making local AI accessible and manageable.

## v1.1 Requirements (All Complete)

### Models Panel (3/3)

- [x] **MODELS-01**: Search/filter bar anchored to top of panel with scrollable model list below
- [x] **MODELS-02**: When download starts, original model tile is hidden and download tile appears at top
- [x] **MODELS-03**: Normal model tiles do not show progress bars (progress only on download tiles)

### Server Panel (3/3)

- [x] **SERVER-01**: Profile selection via searchable dropdown with Start button (replaces profile list)
- [x] **SERVER-02**: Running servers display as rich tiles showing: profile name, model name, memory consumption (graphical), GPU/CPU usage (graphical), uptime, stop/restart buttons
- [x] **SERVER-03**: Scroll position preserved across 5-second polling updates (no scroll jump)

### Authentication (6/6)

- [x] **AUTH-01**: User registration with email + password (first user becomes admin)
- [x] **AUTH-02**: Subsequent users request accounts, admin must approve before active
- [x] **AUTH-03**: JWT-based authentication with 7-day session duration
- [x] **AUTH-04**: Unauthenticated requests redirect to /login page
- [x] **AUTH-05**: Admin user management page (approve, delete, reset passwords)
- [x] **AUTH-06**: Pending approval badge count in nav (admin only)

### Model Discovery (4/4)

- [x] **DISC-01**: Detect model characteristics from config.json or metadata (architecture, context window, multimodal, KV cache)
- [x] **DISC-02**: Visual badges for capabilities (text-only vs multimodal, architecture type, quantization)
- [x] **DISC-03**: Filter/search by model characteristics
- [x] **DISC-04**: Best effort to determine model "tool-use" capability and add a badge to the model

### Profile Enhancements (2/2)

- [x] **PRO-01**: The model description in a profile should be a text area not a simple input field
- [x] **PRO-02**: The Profile should also have a default system prompt field which is used when starting the server

### Chat Multimodal (4/4)

- [x] **CHAT-01**: Thinking model support (collapsible thinking panel, handle various formats)
- [x] **CHAT-02**: Multimodal support — attach images via button and drag-drop
- [x] **CHAT-03**: Video attachments (frame extraction or direct if model supports)
- [x] **CHAT-04**: Integrate small MCP mock for get_weather or calculator to test if models use tools correctly

### Bug Fixes (7/7)

- [x] **BUGFIX-01**: Silent exception swallowing — add logging to all `except Exception: pass` blocks
- [x] **BUGFIX-02**: Server process log file cleanup — guaranteed cleanup on crash/exit
- [x] **BUGFIX-03**: Assertion-based validation — replace `assert` with proper HTTPException in routers
- [x] **BUGFIX-04**: Frontend polling interval — adaptive polling or WebSocket for server status
- [x] **BUGFIX-05**: Console.log pollution — remove debug logging from production code
- [x] **BUGFIX-06**: Sometimes models are marked as already started in Servers, but they fail to load when starting a chat — needs move investigation
- [x] **BUGFIX-07**: The Servers CPU gauge doesn't change it is always showing 0% the memory gauge also doesn't seem to work is showing 387Mb for Qwen3-Coder which is a model of 16Gb size
