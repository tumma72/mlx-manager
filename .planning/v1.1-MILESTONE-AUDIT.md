## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.1 AUDIT PASSED**

The MLX Model Manager v1.1 milestone is complete with:
- 29/29 requirements satisfied
- 6/6 phases verified
- 7/7 integration points wired
- 4/4 E2E flows confirmed
- Quality gates passing (tests, linting, type checking)

Minor tech debt identified is non-blocking (upstream limitations, acceptable fallbacks). The single warning-level item (download completion UX) is a polish issue that can be addressed in v1.2.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with `/gsd:complete-milestone 1.1` to archive and tag.
