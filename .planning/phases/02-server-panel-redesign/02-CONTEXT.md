# Phase 2: Server Panel Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The server panel should feel like a dashboard — running servers are the main event, front and center. When you open it, you immediately see what's actually happening: which servers are running, how they're performing, whether they're healthy.

Profile selection (starting new servers) is available but tucked away, not competing for attention. The focus is on monitoring and controlling what's live.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Real-time metrics** - Live performance data (memory, CPU/GPU, throughput) updating as servers run
- **Clean visual hierarchy** - Running servers clearly distinguished from the "start new server" controls
- **Quick actions** - Stop/restart buttons accessible without hunting

All three matter equally — it's about the whole experience coming together as one cohesive panel.

## Specific Ideas

- Dashboard-style layout with running servers as the main view
- Compact cards for server tiles — information-dense, multiple servers visible without scrolling
- Each tile shows both status (health, uptime, model) AND performance (memory, CPU/GPU, throughput)
- Profile selection via searchable dropdown, not a list taking up space
