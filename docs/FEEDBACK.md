DONE: 1. Refactor data model and relationship, do not mix SQLModel with FastAPI Request/Response models are 2 different things, Model is defined and semantically correct, while view adapt to read what necessary from the model and update what necessary
DONE: 2. Refactor UI component to consistently read from the models, using the right properties, and add switch for API kind to Chat (Anthropic vs OpenAI). Only text and vision models should have the chat button the other not
DONE: 3. Refactor Adapters to be self-contained and configured once then acting as a processing pipeline at every model response. The mlx_server should just throw at them the raw model response and the Adapters do the rest. They should be used for all models so that from the Server perspective all models are equal, they receive a routed request, they generate an output, deliver it to the adapter which produces a valid and protocol compliant response (probably which should have Adapter + Protocol (Anthropic or OpenAI))
IN PROGRESS: 4. Update probing process to leverage new Adapters infrastructure
5. Genralize adapters even more, we do not need an adapter class per family we can keep the families as well as variables and instantiate a generic adapter at loading time using: type, family, model, then read from the database the specific configuration and instantiate an adapter with those configuration. The tool use parsers and the thinking parsers are stateless callable, and there is no other specific family quirk in the family adapter approach, so things could be even simpler, and eliminate a lot of boilerplate code.
6. DevStral (Mistral) family adapter is not recognizing Devstral models correctly
7. Cancel button on started downloads, pause/resume as well
8. Settings are broken need to be updated possibly using tabs because the page is getting very long especially with the providers configuration and the logging which should definitely have its own page
